## Business Introduction

Uber operates a high-volume ride-hailing service across major UK cities, handling thousands of ride requests monthly. In a competitive and time-sensitive mobility market, leadership requires clear visibility into demand patterns, revenue drivers, and operational bottlenecks to optimize performance.

This project provides an executive-level analysis of ride activity to understand customer usage patterns, peak demand periods, revenue distribution, and service challenges impacting conversion and customer experience.

---

## Problem Statement

Uber UK lacked a consolidated performance view to answer critical operational and strategic questions:

- When is demand and revenue highest?
- Which locations generate the most revenue?
- Which ride types drive revenue mix?
- Where are requests being lost?
- What causes cancellations?
- How effective is driver supply during peak periods?

Without these insights, operational decisions risk being reactive instead of data-driven.

Build an Excel dashboard to monitor operational performance, identify revenue opportunities, and highlight service gaps.

**Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel  

**Techniques Applied:**
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Pivot tables and calculated metrics
- Trend and distribution analysis
- KPI tracking
- Visual storytelling

**Key Metrics:**
- Ride requests
- Revenue
- Customers
- Drivers
- Miles covered
- Ratings
- Completion rate
- Cancellation rate

## Dashboard 1 — Demand & Revenue Performance

### Executive Summary

Dashboard 1 focuses on commercial performance, showing how revenue is generated across time, ride types, locations, and key contributors. It highlights concentration patterns and peak demand windows that inform supply allocation and pricing strategy.

### KPI Performance

- **Total Ride Requests:** 9.5K  
- **Active Drivers:** 61  
- **Total Customers:** 1.2K  
- **Total Miles Covered:** 96.2K  
- **Total Revenue:** £303.3K  
- **Average Rating:** 3.0  

The rating indicates potential service experience challenges that could impact retention.

### Revenue by Pickup Location

Revenue is concentrated in a few high-demand hubs, indicating strong commuter and high-footfall zones. These areas should receive priority driver coverage during peak hours.

### Revenue Concentration

A small group of drivers and customers contributes a significant portion of revenue, highlighting both opportunity (replication of success behaviors) and risk (over-reliance).

### Revenue Mix by Ride Type

- UberX — 34.11%
- Uber Comfort — 26.89%
- UberBlack — 20.22%
- UberXL — 18.78%

UberX remains the core revenue driver while premium services contribute a significant share.

### Revenue by Time of Day

- Morning — 55%
- Afternoon — 17%
- Evening — 16%
- Night — 12%

Demand is heavily commuter-driven, making morning supply alignment critical.

### Revenue Trends

Monthly and hourly trends reveal seasonality and daily peaks, enabling better forecasting and driver scheduling optimization.

---

## Dashboard 2 — Operations & Service Quality

### Ride Status Analysis

- Completed — 67.39%
- Cancelled — 22.49%
- No Driver — 10.22%

Nearly one-third of demand is not converted into completed rides, representing significant revenue leakage.

### Ride Type Comparison

Ride types show varying levels of requests, revenue, and distance contribution, indicating different profitability and operational needs.

### Driver Performance

Top drivers vary across revenue, distance, and feedback metrics, enabling targeted incentives and performance coaching strategies.

### Cancellation Reasons

Top causes:

- Not the same driver — 341
- Driver asked to cancel — 302
- Driver was rude — 301
- Chatty driver — 234
- Long wait time — 229
- Accidental request — 224
- Not the same car — 204

Most issues relate to trust, service quality, and supply timing.

---

## Recommendations

### Improve Matching Accuracy
Strengthen driver identity verification and dispatch reliability to reduce expectation mismatches.

### Reduce Driver-Initiated Cancellations
Introduce monitoring and incentives tied to completion rates.

### Improve Service Quality
Implement targeted training and reward high-feedback drivers.

### Align Supply to Morning Peaks
Increase driver availability during morning hours where most revenue is generated.

### Reduce Accidental Requests
Improve confirmation flow and introduce short cancellation grace periods.

---

## Measurable Impact

Estimated revenue per completed ride ≈ £47  

### Scenario: Reduce cancellations by 3 percentage points
Additional rides ≈ 285  
Revenue increase ≈ £13.4K  

### Scenario: Reduce “No Driver” rate by 3 percentage points
Additional rides ≈ 285  
Revenue increase ≈ £13.4K  

### Combined Potential Impact
✅ ~570 additional rides  
✅ ~£26.8K additional revenue  

Improving ratings would further increase retention and lifetime value.

---

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a clear operational and commercial view of Uber UK ride activity in 2025.

Key insights:

- Morning demand drives most revenue
- Conversion gaps represent immediate revenue opportunities
- Cancellation drivers are largely preventable
- Service quality improvements can boost retention

By improving reliability, matching accuracy, and peak-hour supply alignment, Uber can unlock meaningful revenue growth while improving customer satisfaction.
